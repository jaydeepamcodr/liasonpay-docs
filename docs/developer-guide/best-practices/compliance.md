# Compliance Requirements

Adhering to regulatory requirements and industry standards is essential when processing payments and handling customer data. This guide outlines key compliance considerations for your LiasonPay integration.

## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

### PCI DSS Overview

PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

### Compliance Levels

|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Level 1 | Merchants processing over 6 million transactions per year | Annual on-site assessment by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) |
| Level 2 | Merchants processing 1-6 million transactions per year | Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) |
| Level 3 | Merchants processing 20,000-1 million e-commerce transactions per year | Annual SAQ |
| Level 4 | Merchants processing fewer than 20,000 e-commerce transactions per year | Annual SAQ |

### Key Requirements

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network**
   - Install and maintain a firewall configuration
   - Change vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords

2. **Protect Cardholder Data**
   - Protect stored cardholder data
   - Encrypt transmission of cardholder data

3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
   - Use and regularly update anti-virus software
   - Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
   - Restrict access to cardholder data

### PCI DSS Implementation with LiasonPay

Using LiasonPay can significantly reduce your PCI DSS scope:

1. **Use LiasonPay's Hosted Checkout**
   - Card data is handled directly by LiasonPay
   - Your servers never see or process card data
   - Qualifies for SAQ A (simplest compliance path)

2. **If Using API Integration**
   - Never store, process, or transmit card data
   - Use tokenization for recurring payments
   - Implement proper security measures

```javascript
// GOOD: Using LiasonPay's hosted checkout
const checkoutSession = await liasonpay.payments.process({
  store_id: "STORE_123",
  currency: "usd",
  products: [{ name: "Product", price: 100, quantity: 1 }],
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  cancel_url: "https://example.com/cancel",
  mode: "production"
});

// Redirect to LiasonPay's hosted checkout
window.location.href = checkoutSession.data.checkout_url;
```

    if (!isVerified) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Identity verification failed' });
    }
    
    // Process the request based on type
    switch (req.body.requestType) {
      case 'access':

   - Require at least two of the following:
     - Something the customer knows (password, PIN)
     - Something the customer has (phone, hardware token)
     - Something the customer is (biometrics)

2. **Dynamic Linking**
   - Authentication must be linked to a specific amount and recipient

3. **Exemptions**
   - Low-value transactions (under â‚¬30)
   - Recurring transactions of the same amount to the same recipient
   - Transactions assessed as low-risk

### SCA Implementation with LiasonPay

LiasonPay handles SCA requirements automatically:

1. **3D Secure 2.0**
   - LiasonPay implements 3D Secure 2.0 for card payments
   - Dynamically applies SCA when required
   - Handles exemptions appropriately

2. **Recurring Payments**
   - Initial payment requires SCA
   - Subsequent payments may be exempt
   - LiasonPay manages this automatically

```javascript
// LiasonPay handles SCA automatically
const subscription = await liasonpay.subscription.create({
  store_id: "STORE_123",
  price_id: "PRICE_ABC",
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
  cancel_url: "https://example.com/cancel",
  mode: "production"
});

// Redirect to LiasonPay's checkout with SCA when required
window.location.href = subscription.data.checkout_url;
```
