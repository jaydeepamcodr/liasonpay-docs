# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to ensure a smooth integration with the LiasonPay API and provide the best experience for your users.

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management

- **Never expose API keys in client-side code** or public repositories
- Store API keys securely using environment variables or a secure key management service
- Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use different API keys for different applications or services
- Implement the principle of least privilege by limiting API key access

### Data Security

- Always use HTTPS for all API requests
- Minimize the storage of sensitive payment information
- Implement proper data encryption for any stored payment data
- Comply with PCI DSS requirements if storing card information
- Implement proper access controls for payment data

## Integration Best Practices

### Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling for all API requests
- Provide user-friendly error messages to your customers
- Log detailed error information for debugging purposes
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Monitor API errors to identify and resolve issues quickly

### Webhooks

- Implement webhook handlers for all relevant events
- Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- Acknowledge webhook receipt promptly (return 200 response)
- Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhook events

### Testing

- Test thoroughly in the sandbox environment before going live
- Create automated tests for critical payment flows
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Perform load testing to ensure your integration can handle peak traffic
- Conduct regular security testing

## Performance Best Practices

### Optimization

- Cache non-sensitive, relatively static data (e.g., package information)
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Minimize the number of API requests by batching operations when possible
- Use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Optimize database queries related to payment processing

### Monitoring

- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for unusual activity or error spikes
- Track payment conversion rates and drop-offs
- Monitor webhook delivery and processing
- Regularly review API usage and optimize as needed

## User Experience Best Practices

### Checkout Flow

- Minimize the number of steps in the checkout process
- Provide clear error messages and recovery paths
- Display a progress indicator during payment processing
- Offer multiple payment methods to increase conversion
- Implement mobile-friendly payment flows

### Subscription Management

- Provide clear information about subscription terms and billing cycles
- Send notifications before charging for renewals
- Make it easy for users to update payment methods
- Provide a clear cancellation process
- Handle failed payments gracefully with retry logic

## Compliance Best Practices

- Clearly communicate your terms of service and privacy policy
- Obtain appropriate consent for storing and processing payment information
- Comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Maintain detailed records of payment transactions
- Implement proper dispute and refund processes

## Next Steps
